# Inheritance-Day1
A simple Java program demonstrating inheritance, where a Child class acquires fields and methods from a Parent class using extends. Shows how inheritance promotes code reusability by avoiding duplicate code.


# Java Inheritance Example

This project demonstrates **single inheritance** in Java.  
A `Child` class inherits fields and methods from a `Parent` class using the `extends` keyword, showing how inheritance promotes **code reusability**.

## Features
- Inherits variables (`height`, `colour`, `noseStructure`) from the `Parent` class.
- Inherits methods (`readingNewspaper()`, `noDrinking()`, `noSmoking()`).
- Demonstrates the `extends` keyword in action.
